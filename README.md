Integration of Machine Learning Models with SQL Databases

This repository contains the source code, scripts, and configurations used for the experiments and implementations described in my Master's thesis:

Title: Developing a Machine Learning Framework for Automated Data Quality Assurance in SQL Databased
Author: Darshan Gangappa

Requirements
Python 3.x

[List Python Libraries: e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, SQLAlchemy, etc.]

SQL Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)

Install and configure your SQL database (MySQL/PostgreSQL).

Run the SQL scripts located in the sql_scripts/ folder to set up the database schema.

Update database connection details in the configuration files if necessary.
